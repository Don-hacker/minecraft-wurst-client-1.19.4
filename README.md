and press enter the game, it will install some files automatically.

6. Now enjoy your client, join a server/world, and press right shift to open/close mod menu, click on the hacks to enable them. Be sure not to be caught hacking on the server!

7. There are some automatic keybinds attached to the client, ex.- after pressing 'r' key 'killaura' gets activated.
Which attacks every entity near you. You can also edit hacks and apply filters in the hacks by going to the mod menu and
clicking on the green arrow beside the hack name. You can also set keybinds for hacks.

8. For using baritone, type #command
for ex. #mine oak_log
etc..
for more baritone commands, search google about baritone commands.

Thank you
